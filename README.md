## Why?
Javascript is awesome but very often I find repositories that cannot be maintained/used on Windows. Sometimes the maintainers of these repos even don't know that something doesn't run on Windows because nobody of the team uses Windows.

I want to change this. **Please help me making OSS dx great on all platforms again!**

I'll regularly go through all reported issues and try to solve them. Please don't think I am a pro on your codebase or I have some magical superpowers but I'll do my best to help whenever I can!


## Which types of issues can be added?
- It is not a port of an existing feature for other platforms
- No additional stuff needs to be installed (like other language runtimes, databases,... I really don't want to mess up my system multiple times a day)
- The bug must be reproduceable

## How to add an issue?
- Please include the repo name to the issue. E.g.: `webpack-validator: 'npm run test' not working on windows`
- Link to the original issue and provide a summary if it's a long thread. This can save lots of time that could be spent on fixing the issue
